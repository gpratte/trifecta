    header: "Using React State Instead of Redux",
    body: `<p></p>
      <p>I thought making a copy of the seating in the redux store for the UI (see previous blog post) is a bit clunky. I talked to one of the expert react/redux developers at work and he said that using react state instead of the redux store is another possibility (along with a disclaimer that he has not looked at the code yet to know for sure what I am trying to achieve).</p>
      <p>I changed the SeatingConfig react component to create the seating state from the game.seating values in the constructor. Then the SeatingConfig and its two subcomponents, SeatingSeatsPerTable and SeatingPlayerAtTable, use the react state to save the fields that are set in the UI.</p>
      <p>When the SeatingConfig modal dialog is submitted the react state is used to get the values and then packaged to call the redux store to upsert the seating.</p>
      <p>I had to force the SeatingConfig modal dialog component to remount when it is shown so that the constructor can set the state. Did this by adding a key which changes when it is time for the modal dialog to appear.</p>
      <pre><SeatingConfig key={game.showConfigureSeatingKey} game={game}/></pre>

      <p>The modal dialog was a part of the react component that shows a list of the players in the game. At the bottom of the list there is a button to add a player which bring up the modal dialog. As per the bootstrap documentation I put the modal state to show/hide in the react component.</p>
      <p>I wanted to move the modal dialog into its own react component. This means the button to add a player is in one component and the modal itself is in another component. How to handle the show/hide state? Redux of course!</p>
      <p>To get this to work the following changes were made</p>
      <ul>
        <li>the redux store now has a showAddExistingPlayer boolean.</li>
        <li>a new TOGGLE_ADD_EXISTING_PLAYER_TO_GAME action</li>
        <li>the reducer changes the value of the showAddExistingPlayer in the store when it gets an TOGGLE_ADD_EXISTING_PLAYER_TO_GAME action</li>
        <li>when the add player button is clicked it dispatches the TOGGLE_ADD_EXISTING_PLAYER_TO_GAME action</li>
        <li>a new AddExistingPlayer component which is a modal dialog. It shows/hides whenever the showAddExistingPlayer store is changed by the reducer.</li>

      <ol>
        <li>learning redux for the first time</li>
        <li>I have a lot of react components</li>
      </ol>
      <p>I simplified the scope of wiring up redux by concentrating on being able to add an existing league player to the current game. But this was still too much to do in this application (e.g. getting the player information from a react bootstrap modal dialog). So to simplify things even more I created a very small repository where I got things working. See <a href="https://github.com/gpratte/redux-toy-poker-game">https://github.com/gpratte/redux-toy-poker-game</a></p>

It does not make sense to refactor my todo list to incorporate redux since I already know how to do it (whatâ€™s the challenge in that). The goal of learning react/redux is firstly to rewrite my front end for my poker league app and secondly for work.

      <h4>Step 1. Deploy Spring Boot application to Heroku</h4>
      <p>I followed the steps in the getting started on Heroku with Java tutorial. See <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-java">https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-java</a></p>
      <p>The only thing of interest is the Procfile</p>
      <em>web: java -jar application/target/texastoc-application-1.0.jar â€“server.port=$PORT â€“spring.profiles.active=test com.texastoc.Application</em>
      <p>As you can see the Spring Boot application is run as a jar.
        <br>Set the server port as instructed by Heroku.
        <br>Set the spring.profiles.active to test so the it would use the embedded H2 database (for now).
      </p>
      <h4>Step 2. Integrate CircleCI to deploy to Heroku</h4>
      <p>Next I followed the CircleCI instructions to integrate with Heroku. See <a href="https://circleci.com/integrations/heroku/">https://circleci.com/integrations/heroku/</a></p>
      <p>First I had to set a couple environment variables</p>
      <ul>
        <li>HEROKU_APP_NAME</li>
        <li>HEROKU_API_KEY</li>

      <h4>Step 3. Spring Actuator</h4>
      <p>I needed to verify the deployment. What better way than to add a new endpoint (or two) to the server, push to github master and then curl the endpoint on the server deployed to Heroku.</p>
      <p>I added Spring Actuator and curled the health endpoint. See <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/production-ready.html">https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/production-ready.html</a> to know more about Spring Actuator.</p>`,

      <ul>
        <li>add a .circleci directory to my project</li>
        <li>add a config.yml in the .circleci directory for a Java maven project</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Now when I push to any branch CircleCI it downloads dependencies, compiles and run the tests.</p>
      <p>Of course there were problems ðŸ™‚</p>

      <h4>Problem 1</h4>
      <p>My Java project is split into two modules: application and integration. That way I keep my integration tests separate from the application code. The integration module has a dependency on the application module.</p>
      <p>I did not have a problem running the tests locally either in IntelliJ or using maven on the command line. But CircleCI choked on the integration module having a dependency on the application module. CircleCI actually wanted the application module as a library for the integration module to use.</p>
      <p>I changed the config.yml so that the application module created a library.</p>

      <h4>Problem 2</h4>
      <p>When CircleCI attempted to run the test there was an <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50661648/spring-boot-fails-to-run-maven-surefire-plugin-classnotfoundexception-org-apache">obscure error</a>.</p>
      <p>I followed the instructions to add an ssh key to github which allowed me to run CircleCI in ssh mode. I was able to ssh into the build and look at the dump file. I googled the error and found a workaround that I added to my maven pom.xml.</p>
      <p>Of course I added a comment to the pom.xml to a link to the stackoverflow solution to the file.</p>`,

      <p>The WireMock server running on Heroku gets torn down if there is no activity for a 30 minute period. Hence the bash script to create the mock APIs will need to be run each time the server is created by Heroku.
