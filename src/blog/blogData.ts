    body: `<p>Time for some architecture diagrams. There were two front runners that I wanted to explore for documenting the architecture</p>
      <ul>
        <li>C4 model (see <a href="https://c4model.com/">https://c4model.com/</a>)</li>
        <li>Arc42 (see <a href="https://arc42.org/">https://arc42.org/</a>)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>After a quick read of the two I chose the C4 model because it felt familiar to me. Systems, containers, components and code is the way I think about software.</p>
      <p>I chose to use <a href="https://www.draw.io/">https://www.draw.io/</a> with the C4 plugin. See the C4 model tooling section at <a href="https://c4model.com/#tooling">https://c4model.com/#tooling</a></p>

    body: `<p>I‚Äôve coded the Angular front end equivalent from the wireframe mockups that were done in bootstrap.</p>
       <p>The Angular pages use mock data that is hardcoded in the corresponding components. For example the current-game.compoent.ts has the mock data for the current-game.component.html.</p>
       <p>Also, there is no Authentication or Authorization (A&A) since there is no server (yet).</p>

      <p>To populate the APIs in WireMock you‚Äôll need to run bash script I created to curl WireMock to create the mock APIs. Clone this github repo (<a href="https://github.com/gpratte/texastoc-v2-swagger-hub">https://github.com/gpratte/texastoc-v2-swagger-hub </a>) and run the create-api.sh bash script. You will also see the yml files for the APIs defined in Swagger Hub in this repo.</p>
      <p>The WireMock server running on Heroku gets torn down if there is no activity for a 30 minute period. Hence the bash script to create the mock APIs will need to be run each time the server is created by Heroku. You can tell when a server is created because the first call to Heroku takes 20 seconds or more and then subsequent calls take a second or less.</p>
      <p>The mock APIs do not verify the request but do return a valid response for all the APIs defined in Swagger Hub. The request verification will come later when it is time to test.</p>' +

      <p>See <a href="http://wiremock.org/">http://wiremock.org/ </a></p>
      <p>In the last blog I have defined APIs in swagger hub. Now I need a way to exercise those APIs. I‚Äôm very glad to have found WireMock.</p>
      <p>I followed the getting started guide to run WireMock locally (<a href="http://wiremock.org/docs/getting-started/">http://wiremock.org/docs/getting-started/ </a>). It must be a Spring Boot jar üôÇ </p>
      <p>I downloaded the standalone jar and ran it on port 9999.</p>
      <ul>
      <li>java -jar wiremock-standalone-2.18.0.jar ‚Äìport 9999</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I then added a stub API</p>
      <ul>
      <li>curl -X POST http://localhost:9999/__admin/mappings -d &apos;{ "request": { "method": "GET", "url": "/hello1" }, "response": { "body": "Hello world!" }}&apos;</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Exercise the stub</p>
      <ul>
      <li>curl http://localhost:9999/hello1</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Added a new stub to return a json body
      <ul>
      <li>curl -X POST http://localhost:9999/__admin/mappings -d &apos;{ "request‚Äù: { "method‚Äù: "GET‚Äù, "url‚Äù: "/hello2‚Äù }, "response‚Äù: { "jsonBody‚Äù: {"Hello‚Äù: "world!‚Äù }}}&apos;
      </ul>
      <p>Exercise the stub",
      <ul>
      <li>curl http://localhost:9999/hello2</li>",
      </ul>
      <p>To see all stub mappings",
      <ul>
      <li>curl http://localhost:9999/__admin/</li>",
      </ul>
      <p>See <a href="http://wiremock.org/docs/stubbing/">http://wiremock.org/docs/stubbing/</a> for more ways to stub.</p>
      <p>Shutdown the local server
      <ul>
      <li>curl -X POST http://localhost:9999/__admin/shutdown</li>
      </ul>",
      <p>Next I deployed the WireMock server to Heroku. You can too. See my github repo <a href="https://github.com/gpratte/wiremock-deploy-heroku">https://github.com/gpratte/wiremock-deploy-heroku</a></p>`,

      <li>Mark players that finish in the top 10 of a game</li>
      <li>Calculates payouts in a game</li>
